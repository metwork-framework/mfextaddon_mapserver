# Cheatsheet



## `root` service commands

As `root` unix user:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `service metwork start` | start all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork stop` | stop all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork status` | check all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork start mfextaddon_mapserver` | start mfextaddon_mapserver metwork services |
| `service metwork stop mfextaddon_mapserver` | stop mfextaddon_mapserver metwork services |
| `service metwork status mfextaddon_mapserver` | check mfextaddon_mapserver metwork services |

> Note: if you don't have `service` command on your Linux distribution, you can use `/etc/rc.d/init.d/metwork` instead of `service metwork`. For example: `/etc/rc.d/init.d/metwork start` instead of `service metwork start`. If your Linux distribution uses `systemd`component, you can also start metwork services with classic `systemctl` commands.



## root files or directories

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/metwork.config.d/mfextaddon_mapserver/config.ini` | override the `mfextaddon_mapserver` module configuration at system level (note: the first line of this file must be `[INCLUDE_config.ini]`) |
| `/opt/metwork-mfextaddon_mapserver/config/config.ini` | default `mfextaddon_mapserver` module configuration (useful to see all configuration options) (**do not edit this file** => use the overriding previous file) |


## "load environment" commands

As a "not metwork" unix user (useless if you are logged as a "mfxxx" unix user as the "metwork environement" is already loaded):

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `source /opt/metwork-mfextaddon_mapserver/share/interactive_profile` | load the mfextaddon_mapserver metwork interactive environment |
| `source /opt/metwork-mfextaddon_mapserver/share/profile` | load the mfextaddon_mapserver metwork environment (same as above but without fancy stuff about banner, colors and prompt) |
| `/opt/metwork-mfextaddon_mapserver/bin/mfextaddon_mapserver_wrapper {YOUR_COMMAND}`| execute the given command in the mfextaddon_mapserver metwork environment without changing anything to the current environment |

> Note: if you don't have `/opt/metwork-mfextaddon_mapserver` symbolic link, use `/opt/metwork-mfextaddon_mapserver-{BRANCH}` instead.
